# Introduction

The `NaiveBayesClassifier` is a custom implementation of the Naive Bayes classification
algorithm, which is widely used for text classification tasks such as spam detection,
sentiment analysis, and more. This class is designed to train on labeled text data,
allowing it to predict the class (e.g., spam or not spam) of new, unlabeled text samples

## TODO: Try others

The Vectorizer use BoW, which is relativly weaken algorithm to the orhers.

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
2. Word Emveddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
3. Sentence Embeddings (Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Enconder)
4. Transformers Algorithms:
   4.1. Transformers
   4.2. Bert
