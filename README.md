# Introduction

The `NaiveBayesClassifier` is a custom implementation of the Naive Bayes classification
algorithm, which is widely used for text classification tasks such as spam detection,
sentiment analysis, and more. This class is designed to train on labeled text data,
allowing it to predict the class (e.g., spam or not spam) of new, unlabeled text samples
